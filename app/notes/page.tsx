    content: `## What This Is

Project ATLAS is a specialized technical services company built on a simple premise: most companies don't need more contractors sitting around - they need problems solved, fast, and then they need those people gone.

I've spent 8 years watching the traditional contracting model fail. Companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman pay premium rates for "expert" contractors through staffing agencies like Apex Systems and Beaconhill, and what do they get? One good person for every eight mediocre ones. People who show up, complain, half-ass the work, and stick around collecting paychecks while systems stay broken.

That's not how it should work.

## The Kelly Johnson Principle

When I started CyberRTS, I based it on Kelly Johnson's Skunk Works principles: extremely capable teams, versatile people who can handle anything thrown at them, deliver the product and solution in an aggressive timeframe, and then move on. That's what made Skunk Works legendary - small, elite teams that got impossible things done faster than anyone thought possible.

Lockheed Martin used to have something called Tiger Teams. The idea was simple: you've got a critical problem, you call in the Tiger Team, they show up, fix it aggressively, and move to the next problem. But here's the joke everyone knows - the contractors on those "Tiger Teams" and the so-called SMEs are often worse than the junior people. The concept got diluted by the same staffing model that ruins everything else.

## Why ATLAS Exists

There's a gap in the market that nobody is filling properly. Defense contractors, space companies, government programs - they all have the same problem: critical technical issues that need solving right now, not six months from now after a hiring process and onboarding. They don't need permanent headcount. They need a team that can show up, assess the situation, coordinate with their people, execute the solution with precision and speed, and then leave with everything actually working.

Not as traditional contractors. As a specialized team that gets shit done.

We bypass all the bullshit. No fluffed resumes. No staffing agency markup for mediocre talent. No contractors optimizing for billable hours instead of outcomes. We vet our own people. We know they're capable because we've worked with them, and they've proven they can deliver under pressure.

## What an ATLAS Deployment Looks Like

You've got a problem. Maybe it's a critical system that's not working. Maybe it's a capability gap that's holding up a program. Maybe it's integration work that's become a nightmare because nobody on site really understands what's happening.

You deploy an ATLAS team.

We show up. We assess. We coordinate. We execute. The system works. We leave.

Clean. Professional. Fast. No drama.

That's it. That's what we do.

## Why This Matters Now

The traditional model is broken and everyone knows it. Companies are stuck with half-working systems and people who complain instead of solve. There's no pride in the work anymore, and it shows in the results.

The space industry, defense programs, critical infrastructure - these domains need people who can move fast, work across multiple disciplines, and actually deliver. The stakes are too high for mediocrity.

Project ATLAS is about bringing back the standard that used to exist. Elite teams. Real expertise. Aggressive execution. Results you can count on.

We're not trying to be another consulting firm or another body shop. We're building something different - a company where excellence isn't just talked about, it's required. Where speed matters. Where finishing the job and moving on is the entire point.`

    title: "Disrupting the Contracting Model",
    date: "Business Model",
    category: "Strategy",
    content: `## The Problem with How Things Work Now

The traditional contracting model is fundamentally broken because the incentives are backwards.

Staffing agencies get paid by the hour. Contractors get paid by the hour. Prime contractors bill by the hour. Everyone in the chain makes more money the longer the work takes. Nobody has skin in the game for actually solving the problem and moving on.

What happens? Projects drag on. Scope expands. People optimize for staying busy, not finishing. The customer ends up paying premium rates for mediocre talent that sticks around indefinitely while the actual problem maybe gets solved, maybe doesn't.

I've seen it over and over. Companies pay $150-200/hour for a "senior systems administrator" or "cybersecurity expert" through an agency, and half the time that person is barely competent. But once they're in, they're hard to get rid of. The staffing contract is already signed. The prime is already billing. Everyone just accepts it.

That's insane.

## How We Break the Model

We do the opposite of everything that doesn't work.

**Fixed-Price SOW Engagements**

We don't bill by the hour. We don't do time and materials. We charge a fixed price per engagement based on a Statement of Work.

Here's how it works:

1. **Assessment Phase**: We show up and assess what the actual problem is and what you really need. This might be a day or two, either a small fixed fee or free depending on the situation.
2. **SOW Proposal**: We produce a Statement of Work that defines exactly what we're going to deliver, the timeline, and the price. It's clear. It's specific. It's binding on both sides.
3. **Execute**: We do the work. If we finish early because we're good, that's our reward. If it takes longer than we estimated and it's our fault, we eat it and finish anyway. We don't come back asking for more money.
4. **Deliver and Extract**: The system works. Documentation is handed over. Our team leaves.

If something changes mid-engagement that's legitimately out of scope - like you suddenly need us to integrate with a completely different system you didn't mention - that's a new SOW. But we're strict about this. Scope creep is the enemy of this model.

**Why This Works**

The incentives are finally aligned correctly.

The faster and better we execute, the better our margins. Our team isn't trying to stretch work to hit utilization targets. They're trying to solve the problem as efficiently as possible because that's how everyone makes money.

The customer gets predictability. They know exactly what they're getting and what it costs. No surprise overruns. No wondering if their contractors are really working or just sending status update emails all day.

And here's the key: we take on all the delivery risk. That only works if we're actually good. If we hire mediocre people or scope projects badly, we lose money fast. The model itself enforces excellence.

## What This Means for How We Operate

**We Stay Small and Elite**

We can't afford to hire average people. Every person on an ATLAS team needs to be capable, versatile, and able to work under pressure. The Kelly Johnson principle: small teams of extremely capable people who can handle anything.

We vet people ourselves. No relying on resumes or agency recruiters. We know they can deliver because we've worked with them or they've been vouched for by someone we trust completely.

**We Move Fast**

Traditional contracting is slow because everyone's getting paid either way. We're the opposite. Speed is built into the model. The faster we deliver quality results, the more engagements we can take on, the more money we make, the better our reputation gets.

**We're Ruthless About Scope**

The SOW is sacred. We define it clearly up front. We deliver exactly what we said we would. If the customer wants something else, that's a different engagement. No exceptions.

This protects us and it protects the customer. Everyone knows exactly what's happening.

**We Build Reputation Through Results**

In defense and space, word travels fast. If you consistently show up, deliver what you said you would in the timeline you committed to, and the stuff actually works? That's worth everything.

One good engagement leads to three more. One program manager who trusts you brings you into their next program. That's how this scales - through reputation, not through sales teams and marketing bullshit.

## Why Customers Will Buy This

Defense primes and government programs are exhausted from contracts that drag on forever and cost more than anyone planned. They're used to thinking in terms of SOWs and deliverables anyway. They understand fixed-price contracts.

What they're not used to is a company that actually delivers on time for the price they quoted.

Finance people love this because it's predictable. Program managers love this because they can actually plan around it. Technical people love this because the team that shows up is actually competent.

And here's the thing - they're already paying premium rates for contractors. The money is there. We're just offering better value: elite talent, faster delivery, actual results, and you only pay for what you need.

## The Risk We're Taking On

This model only works if we're honest about what we can and can't do. We have to scope engagements accurately. We have to deliver on our commitments. We have to swallow the cost if we screw up.

That's scary for a lot of companies, which is why nobody does it this way. But it's also what makes this defensible. We're willing to take on the risk because we're confident in our ability to execute.

And that confidence comes from only working with people who have proven they can deliver under pressure, and from being ruthless about what engagements we take on in the first place.`

    content: `## The Core Challenge

Here's the problem with the model we're building: elite people have options. If you're actually good - the kind of person who can show up to a broken system, figure out what's wrong, and fix it fast - you can get hired anywhere. You don't need us.

So why would someone join an ATLAS team instead of taking a cushy full-time job or a traditional contracting gig with guaranteed hours?

Because the traditional model sucks for good people too.

## What Elite People Actually Want

I've worked with the best people in this industry, and I've worked with the worst. The difference isn't just skill - it's mindset.

The best people hate the bullshit. They hate sitting in meetings that don't matter. They hate working on teams where half the people are dead weight. They hate projects that drag on forever because nobody actually cares about finishing. They hate optimizing for looking busy instead of getting things done.

What they want is simple:

- Work that matters
- Teams that don't suck
- The ability to execute without bureaucracy getting in the way
- To be paid well for their skills
- And honestly? They want to finish something and move on, not maintain it forever

Traditional jobs don't offer that. Traditional contracting definitely doesn't offer that. But ATLAS does.

## How the ATLAS Team Model Works

Think of it like special operations deployments, but for technical problems.

**You're Part of an Elite Team**

You're not just another contractor. You're part of ATLAS. That means something. Everyone on the team is vetted. Everyone is capable. Everyone pulls their weight. No passengers.

When you deploy on an engagement, you know the people next to you can handle their shit. That matters more than most people realize. Working with competent people who care about the work is rare, and once you've experienced it, you don't want to go back to normal teams.

**Deployments, Not Contracts**

This is the key difference. You're not signing up for a 6-month or 12-month contract where you show up every day whether there's real work or not. You're deploying for specific engagements.

An engagement might be 2 weeks. Might be 6 weeks. Rarely longer than that because we scope them to be completable in aggressive timeframes.

You show up. You execute. You finish. You go home.

If the team is moving fast and you finish a 4-week SOW in 3 weeks? Great. You still get paid for the engagement value, and you've got extra time before the next one.

**Financial Models**

We offer three retention models:

**Option 1: Retainer + Engagement Bonuses**

Core team members get a base retainer to keep them available and committed. When an engagement comes in, everyone on that deployment gets their share of the SOW value. The faster and cleaner we execute, the better the effective rate becomes.

**Option 2: Per-Engagement with Priority**

Some people don't want the retainer model. That's fine. They're in the network. When we have an engagement that needs their specific skills, they get first call.

**Option 3: Full Salary, Deployment Model**

We keep you on full salary as a company employee. When you're deployed, you're working hard. When you're not deployed, you do whatever you want. The deal is simple: when we call for deployment, you show up ready to execute.

We swallow the cost during gaps. This only works if we're confident we'll have consistent work coming in, but that's the bet we're making.

## Why People Stay

The mistake most companies make is thinking retention is just about money. Money matters, but it's not everything.

People stay with ATLAS because:

**1. Pride in the Work**

You're part of something that actually works. When someone says "we deployed an ATLAS team," that means something. It means the problem got solved. It means quality work. It means professionals who give a shit.

**2. Quality of Life**

You're not grinding 50 weeks a year. You're deploying for intense periods, executing at a high level, and then you've got time to breathe.

**3. Team Culture**

You know everyone on an ATLAS team earned their place. Nobody's coasting. The standard is high and it's maintained.

**4. Financial Upside**

The model rewards performance. If we execute well and build reputation, we can take on more engagements at higher rates. Everyone benefits.

## The Bottom Line

We keep people by being honest about what this is and what it isn't.

This isn't a traditional job. This isn't even traditional contracting. It's something different - deployments with elite teams to solve hard problems fast, get paid well, and move on.

For the right people, that's exactly what they want. For everyone else, they can stay in the traditional model.

We're only looking for the right people.`
