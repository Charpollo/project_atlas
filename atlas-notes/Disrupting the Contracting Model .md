# Disrupting the Contracting Model

## The Problem with How Things Work Now

The traditional contracting model is fundamentally broken because the incentives are backwards.

Staffing agencies get paid by the hour. Contractors get paid by the hour. Prime contractors bill by the hour. Everyone in the chain makes more money the longer the work takes. Nobody has skin in the game for actually solving the problem and moving on.

What happens? Projects drag on. Scope expands. People optimize for staying busy, not finishing. The customer ends up paying premium rates for mediocre talent that sticks around indefinitely while the actual problem maybe gets solved, maybe doesn't.

I've seen it over and over. Companies pay $150-200/hour for a "senior systems administrator" or "cybersecurity expert" through an agency, and half the time that person is barely competent. But once they're in, they're hard to get rid of. The staffing contract is already signed. The prime is already billing. Everyone just accepts it.

That's insane.

## How We Break the Model

We do the opposite of everything that doesn't work.

**Fixed-Price SOW Engagements**

We don't bill by the hour. We don't do time and materials. We charge a fixed price per engagement based on a Statement of Work.

Here's how it works:

1. **Assessment Phase**: We show up and assess what the actual problem is and what you really need. This might be a day or two, either a small fixed fee or free depending on the situation.
2. **SOW Proposal**: We produce a Statement of Work that defines exactly what we're going to deliver, the timeline, and the price. It's clear. It's specific. It's binding on both sides.
3. **Execute**: We do the work. If we finish early because we're good, that's our reward. If it takes longer than we estimated and it's our fault, we eat it and finish anyway. We don't come back asking for more money.
4. **Deliver and Extract**: The system works. Documentation is handed over. Our team leaves.

If something changes mid-engagement that's legitimately out of scope - like you suddenly need us to integrate with a completely different system you didn't mention - that's a new SOW. But we're strict about this. Scope creep is the enemy of this model.

**Why This Works**

The incentives are finally aligned correctly.

The faster and better we execute, the better our margins. Our team isn't trying to stretch work to hit utilization targets. They're trying to solve the problem as efficiently as possible because that's how everyone makes money.

The customer gets predictability. They know exactly what they're getting and what it costs. No surprise overruns. No wondering if their contractors are really working or just sending status update emails all day.

And here's the key: we take on all the delivery risk. That only works if we're actually good. If we hire mediocre people or scope projects badly, we lose money fast. The model itself enforces excellence.

## What This Means for How We Operate

**We Stay Small and Elite**

We can't afford to hire average people. Every person on an ATLAS team needs to be capable, versatile, and able to work under pressure. The Kelly Johnson principle: small teams of extremely capable people who can handle anything.

We vet people ourselves. No relying on resumes or agency recruiters. We know they can deliver because we've worked with them or they've been vouched for by someone we trust completely.

**We Move Fast**

Traditional contracting is slow because everyone's getting paid either way. We're the opposite. Speed is built into the model. The faster we deliver quality results, the more engagements we can take on, the more money we make, the better our reputation gets.

**We're Ruthless About Scope**

The SOW is sacred. We define it clearly up front. We deliver exactly what we said we would. If the customer wants something else, that's a different engagement. No exceptions.

This protects us and it protects the customer. Everyone knows exactly what's happening.

**We Build Reputation Through Results**

In defense and space, word travels fast. If you consistently show up, deliver what you said you would in the timeline you committed to, and the stuff actually works? That's worth everything.

One good engagement leads to three more. One program manager who trusts you brings you into their next program. That's how this scales - through reputation, not through sales teams and marketing bullshit.

## Why Customers Will Buy This

Defense primes and government programs are exhausted from contracts that drag on forever and cost more than anyone planned. They're used to thinking in terms of SOWs and deliverables anyway. They understand fixed-price contracts.

What they're not used to is a company that actually delivers on time for the price they quoted.

Finance people love this because it's predictable. Program managers love this because they can actually plan around it. Technical people love this because the team that shows up is actually competent.

And here's the thing - they're already paying premium rates for contractors. The money is there. We're just offering better value: elite talent, faster delivery, actual results, and you only pay for what you need.

## The Risk We're Taking On

This model only works if we're honest about what we can and can't do. We have to scope engagements accurately. We have to deliver on our commitments. We have to swallow the cost if we screw up.

That's scary for a lot of companies, which is why nobody does it this way. But it's also what makes this defensible. We're willing to take on the risk because we're confident in our ability to execute.

And that confidence comes from only working with people who have proven they can deliver under pressure, and from being ruthless about what engagements we take on in the first place.
