# Project ATLAS (Rough Thoughts)

## What This Is

Project ATLAS is a specialized technical services company built on a simple premise: most companies don't need more contractors sitting around - they need problems solved, fast, and then they need those people gone.

I've spent 8 years watching the traditional contracting model fail. Companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman pay premium rates for "expert" contractors through staffing agencies like Apex Systems and Beaconhill, and what do they get? One good person for every eight mediocre ones. People who show up, complain, half-ass the work, and stick around collecting paychecks while systems stay broken.

That's not how it should work.

## The Kelly Johnson Principle

When I started CyberRTS, I based it on Kelly Johnson's Skunk Works principles: extremely capable teams, versatile people who can handle anything thrown at them, deliver the product and solution in an aggressive timeframe, and then move on. That's what made Skunk Works legendary - small, elite teams that got impossible things done faster than anyone thought possible.

Lockheed Martin used to have something called Tiger Teams. The idea was simple: you've got a critical problem, you call in the Tiger Team, they show up, fix it aggressively, and move to the next problem. But here's the joke everyone knows - the contractors on those "Tiger Teams" and the so-called SMEs are often worse than the junior people. The concept got diluted by the same staffing model that ruins everything else.

## Why ATLAS Exists

There's a gap in the market that nobody is filling properly. Defense contractors, space companies, government programs - they all have the same problem: critical technical issues that need solving right now, not six months from now after a hiring process and onboarding. They don't need permanent headcount. They need a team that can show up, assess the situation, coordinate with their people, execute the solution with precision and speed, and then leave with everything actually working.

Not as traditional contractors. As a specialized team that gets shit done.

We bypass all the bullshit. No fluffed resumes. No staffing agency markup for mediocre talent. No contractors optimizing for billable hours instead of outcomes. We vet our own people. We know they're capable because we've worked with them, and they've proven they can deliver under pressure.

## What an ATLAS Deployment Looks Like

You've got a problem. Maybe it's a critical system that's not working. Maybe it's a capability gap that's holding up a program. Maybe it's integration work that's become a nightmare because nobody on site really understands what's happening.

You deploy an ATLAS team.

We show up. We assess. We coordinate. We execute. The system works. We leave.

Clean. Professional. Fast. No drama.

That's it. That's what we do.

## Why This Matters Now

The traditional model is broken and everyone knows it. Companies are stuck with half-working systems and people who complain instead of solve. There's no pride in the work anymore, and it shows in the results.

The space industry, defense programs, critical infrastructure - these domains need people who can move fast, work across multiple disciplines, and actually deliver. The stakes are too high for mediocrity.

Project ATLAS is about bringing back the standard that used to exist. Elite teams. Real expertise. Aggressive execution. Results you can count on.

We're not trying to be another consulting firm or another body shop. We're building something different - a company where excellence isn't just talked about, it's required. Where speed matters. Where finishing the job and moving on is the entire point.
